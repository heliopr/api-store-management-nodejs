# API for Store Management

# Built with
* NodeJS
* Express
* MariaDB

My initial idea was to implement:
* Products
* Categories
* Suppliers
    * Contacts
* Employees
* Sales

But I ended up giving up on implementing employees and sales because implementing the endpoints started to become very repetitive.

# Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` inside the project folder
3. Create a `.env` file following the example `.envexample`
4. Create a database in your MariaDB database matching the `DATABASE_DATABASE` in your .env
5. Run `node .` to start the server


# Endpoints

## /products
## /categories
## /suppliers
